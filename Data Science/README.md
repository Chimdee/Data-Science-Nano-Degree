#### About this project
In this notebook, using publicly available Airbnb Boston dataset, I did some basic visual exploration and predictive modelling to find answers to following questions.
* Q1: Which area is cheaper/costly to stay in Boston?
* Q2. When is cheap/expensive to stay in Airbnb Boston?
* Q3: What is the most important factor for Airbnb price in Boston?
