    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.\n",

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer: \n",
    "I tried to use three different model, which are simple/NB/, medium/Ensemble methods/ and complex/SVM/ for attacking the problem. I consider the non-linearity and skewness in the dataset when choosing the models. Below are details for the each models.\n",
    "\n",
    "GaussianNB: \n",
    "    - Application could be faulty credit card transaction detector. \n",
    "    - It is very simple and fast. It does not need any derivative calculations like regression models. It also can handle both continuous and discrete data.  \n",
    "    - It assumes that the features are independent to each other, which is not always true. In this case model performs poorly.\n",
    "    - I think the features are not that correlated strongly, so I chose it as one candidate. Also since it is a very simple model, I think it is good have a simple model as a reference benchmark. By comparing the results of simple versus complex models, I can get an idea of how simple/complicated our problem/data is. That makes this model a good candidate.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Ensemble Methods(Random Forest)\n",
    "    - Stock price prediction. Using historical data and potential features, random forest can be used to predict if a stock will go up or down. \n",
    "    - It is robust to overfitting. It can learn non-linear relationship by ensembling. \n",
    "    - Individual trees are prone to overfitting. Tuning parameters requires many trials to get the best result.\n",
    "    - It is very popular methods for machine learning competitions. Additionally, non-linearity and a slight skewness in our dataset make ensembling method a good candidate. Moreover, this method is robust to overfitting, considering that our dataset is not that large and might overfit to models. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Support Vector Machine\n",
    "    - I hear many applications, but one of which can be predicting failures/anomalies in the ship engine using the sensory data. \n",
    "    - SVM uses kernel methods. Kernel methods are powerful for learning non-linear problems. It also has regularization effect which avoids overfitting.  \n",
    "    - On the other hand, kernel tricks can be prone to overfitting. Also SVM can be sensitive to the selection of hyper parameters and the kernel.\n",
    "    - In my opinion, SVM is bit heavy model compared to the above two. But it can show strong results. So I think it is good to compare its performance. Apart from that, non-linearity and complexity in our data makes SVM worth trying.\n",

    "I choose the SVM as the final model based on the preceding results. \n",
    "In terms of evaluation metrics, SVM performs the best F-score on the test datasets. If we take accuracy as evaluation metric, the Random Forest Classifier shows almost the same results as SVM on the test datasets. But if we see its performance on the training data, it shows even better results than on test datasets in terms of both F-score and accuracy, suggeting that it might be overfitted. \n",
    "\n",
    "One major drawback of the SVM is the training/prediction time, which can be clearly seen from the graph above where bars for the other two models are even not visible/very tiny/. I found that the SVM is around 300 times as slow as the Random Forest Classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, that being mentioned, I still prefer the SVM considering the data and the application. I assume that the CharityML will not going to use this algorithm in real time manner where the training/prediction time is one of the most important factors for evaluating the model. And for that case, the Random Forest Classifier would be selected as the most suitable model, which requires much less time. But in this problem I believe accuracy or F-score is the most important metric. I think CharityML would prefer finding one more potential donator than than saving 3 minutes on training time /it takes around 3 minutes for training the model on entire training datasets/.\n"

    "Our goal is to predict whether an individual earns higher than 50k or not, given other informations such as education, age, race etc., which are typically called features in the Machine Learning domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that we draw a scatter plot of individuals on 2D plane and each data points has a color which indicates whether the individuals earns high/>=50k/ or low/<$50k/. For this setting, in simle term, SVM draws a line between target individuals, those who earn more than 50k earning and those who earn less than 50k earning individual. Once we have the line on the plot, using that line, we can predict whether new individual earns more than 50k or not. For example, if a new individual's datapoint falls on the upper side of the line, then that person makes more 50k and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what logic does SVM use when drawing the line? Your are right! There many many more lines that can be drawn on a scatterplot. But SVM can prioritise all those lines by using an error metric that each lines gives. By an error metric, I simply mean how well the line separates the datapoints on the scatter plot into two target groups; if it could manage to neatly/clearly separate the indiduals into the two group then error metric is zero and the line is the best one. Contrarily, if there are many misclassified points in each side of the line, then the errors are higher and the line is not doing great. This is the rough intuition how SVM classify the target variable into two categories based on the errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "But our data is not that simple, and if we made scatter plot we can easily see that it is very hard /actually impossible/ to separate the two category by a straight line. To deal with this challenge,  SVM uses so-called non-linear kernels tricks. It intuitively means that we are drawing non-linear curves to separate the two target categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it is a very powerful model dealing with non-linear problems, but the regularization parameter should be setted wisely to avoid overfitting. Overfitting happens when SVM classify targets in the training datasets perfectly, but fails to do so in the test set or a new dataset. To avoid that the regularization parameter is used, which helps the SVM get the right balance so that the model is not too perfect on training data and is not too bad on the test data."

    "Only 2 out of 5 features that I chose initially were selected by sklearn.feature_importance_ method. Among others, I missed the top contributor which is capital loss. I thought that those sho are wealthy enough to participate in the capital market have more chance to experience capital loss, but might make their push their income under $50k. Apparently, education-number-of-years is more important than the education level. \n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "Both metrics have decreased when we used the reduced data. Accuracy score went down to 0.77 from 0.84 and F-score went down to 0.49 from 0.68. Considering that we have used less than half the features /5 out of 13/, I think 7% decrease in accuracy is not that big loss. But F-score decreased substantially. Therefore, even if training time was a factor, I would not want to use only 5 most important features. But I may want try to use 8 to 10 important features, hoping that they might not results in a big drop in F-score. "
